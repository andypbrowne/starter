From 2014 to 2018 we commemorate the centennial of “The Great War,” so-called because those who experienced it could imagine no conflict more terrible, and could not believe that the same disastrous mistakes could ever be repeated. Removed by as much as three generations from life today, the events of 1914–18 hold lessons and truths about our humanity that could be lost — or worse — be rendered unbelievable.

I would like to share with you some web resources that capture the Centennial, commemorate that time, and show how WWI still shapes our political and cultural environment today.

The Great War was set off June 28, 1914 by a small spark—the assassination of Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie Duchess of Hohenberg. The meaning of this event is summed up expertly by Dan Carlin in a recent CBS This Morning Television Interview (youtube video).

This short interview is just a taste of Carlin’s exhaustive and fascinating five-part podcast series, Blueprint for Armageddon (podcast link).
